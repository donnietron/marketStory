# Narrative visualization of state statistics for farmers markets and agriculture.


1) Number of farmers markets per state

2) Number of farmers markets normalized by pop

3) Percentage of gdp coming from Agriculture

4) Ratio of GDP coming from ag to farmers markets per person.


---
Measure $= \frac{\text{markets per person}}{\% \text{gpd from ag}}$ 

if we have a low gdp % and high per person ratio this becomes small.  


Make the visualization a trend chart.
Each line represents the different steps. At each step a line is animated from it's current position to the next position.

Problems that might arise: Clustering of states. Could put in a search feature to fix this. Point would be to highlight the outlier states.
