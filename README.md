# Narrative visualization of state statistics for farmers markets and agriculture.


1) Number of farmers markets per state

2) Number of farmers markets normalized by pop

3) Percentage of gdp coming from Agriculture

4) Ratio of GDP coming from ag to farmers markets per person.


---
Measure $= \frac{\text{markets per person}}{\% \text{gpd from ag}}$ 

if we have a low gdp % and high per person ratio this becomes small.  


Make the visualization a trend chart.
Each line represents the different steps. At each step a line is animated from it's current position to the next position.

#ToDo: 
- Fix the problem with interaction with the lines messing up the animation. 
- Add a second type of selection: hover select. This is different from clicking on a state select. Make sure that the hover has presidence over the click select. 
- Color code the states by region and/or add buttons to view interesting clusters. 
	- Consider walking the user through the interesting clusters then giving them the reigns to explore at tthe end.
