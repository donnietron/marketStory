# Narrative visualization of state statistics for farmers markets and agriculture.


1) Number of farmers markets per state

2) Number of farmers markets normalized by pop

3) Percentage of gdp coming from Agriculture

4) Ratio of GDP coming from ag to farmers markets per person. 


---
Measure $ = \frac{\text{markets per person}}{\% \text{gpd from ag}}$ 

if we have a low gdp % and high per person ratio this becomes small.
